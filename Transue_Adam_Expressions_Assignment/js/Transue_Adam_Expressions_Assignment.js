/**
 This program will take user input for determined values and will calculate the friction loss through
 a piece of fire hose. Which is determinate of the diameter of the hose and the gallons per minute of water and the
 length of said hose.
 **/




// Variables Will Be Declared here.
var lengthOfHose;  // Empty variable that will be assigned the user input value for the length of the hose
var gallonsPerMinute;  // Empty variable that will be assigned the user input value for the GPM of water that is being flowed
var diameterCoefficient;  // Empty variable that will be assigned the user input value for the Diameter of the Hose being Used
var calculationsTable = []; // An array to be used to store the values of the user input


// User inputs will happen here.
lengthOfHose = prompt("Please Enter the Total Length of the Hose Being Used.");
gallonsPerMinute = prompt("Please Enter the Amount of Water Being Used in Gallons Per Minute.");
diameterCoefficient = prompt("Using the Following Table Please Enter The Coefficient That represents the Diameter of hose being used. \n.75 inches = 1100 \n1.0 inches = 150 \n1.25 inches = 80 \n1.5 inches = 24 \n1.75 inches = 15.5 \n2.0 inches = 8 \n2.5 inches = 2 \n3.0 inches = 0.677 \n3.5 inches = 0.34 \n4.0 inches = 0.2 \n4.5 inches = 0.1 \n5.0 inches = 0.08 \n6.0 inches = 0.05");
